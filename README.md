# Digit-Recognizer
In this project i woked on a MNIST data set which is collection of images of handwritten digits. The images weere 28 x 28 px in size. So,for a single image total 784 feature vectors were generated. I did PCA to the data set and compressed it into 40 features retaining around 97 % of the variation. 
The KNN algorith was applied and it gave a accuracy of 98.35 % . I didn't go for the neural network as the KNN model was giving a significant accuracy.
